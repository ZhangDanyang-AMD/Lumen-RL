"""The IPC receive call must not pass FP8 args a non-vLLM server cannot accept.

ATOMRayServer.update_weights_from_ipc is (use_shm, version) -- no prequantized_fp8.
Passing a third POSITIONAL argument to it raised "TypeError: too many positional
arguments" from inside Ray's own arg validation, which broke release examples 4, 5
and 9 (every ATOM rollout) while every vLLM example passed. Nothing mocked at the
vLLM server could catch that, so the contract is pinned here instead: with FP8 sync
off -- the default -- the call must be exactly two positional args.
