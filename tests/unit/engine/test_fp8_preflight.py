"""``_check_fp8_usable``: refuse an FP8 request the run cannot honour.

Both failure modes it covers are silent-or-misleading without it. A
``build_config`` family (DSv3/DSv4) never receives fp8_kwargs, so the run would
train in BF16 while reporting FP8; and an unsupported recipe only surfaces at
the first forward, minutes in, as a TE traceback.
