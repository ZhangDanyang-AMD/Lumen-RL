"""One-step off-policy rollout: generate step s+1 while step s trains.

With the rollout on its own GPUs (``controller.ray.rollout.num_workers > 0``)
the trainer does not touch the rollout engine while it computes log-probs and
updates the actor, so the next batch can be generated in that window. The
batch trained at step s then comes from the weights synced after step s-1, one
update behind the trainer; the rollout-correction weights account for that gap.
Weights are synced only after the in-flight batch has finished, so the engine
never loads new weights in the middle of a request.
