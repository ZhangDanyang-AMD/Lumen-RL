"""Re-export of the FP8 per-block weight quantizer.

This module was a byte-identical duplicate of
``lumenrl.engine.inference.fp8_weight_quantizer``. Both the training and inference
weight-sync paths already imported the *inference* copy, so the duplicate could only
ever drift out of sync. Kept as a shim so existing imports keep working.
