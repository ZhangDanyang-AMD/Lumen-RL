"""Architecture registry for the Megatron training path.

Replaces the engine's inline ``_is_dsv4`` / ``_is_moe`` booleans, which needed
another branch at every call site per new family. One :class:`ModelSpec` per
family instead; adding an architecture should not mean editing the engine.

Resolution is ordered first-match, so specific families register before general
ones and a catch-all dense entry is last. ``detect`` sees the engine config too,
because an override there can turn a dense config into a MoE run.
