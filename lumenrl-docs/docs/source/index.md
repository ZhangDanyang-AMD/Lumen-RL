# Welcome to LumenRL

**LumenRL** is an AMD native **Post-Training Framework for LLMs**, powered by [Lumen](https://github.com/ZhangDanyang-AMD/Lumen) (quantized training) and [ATOM](https://github.com/ROCm/ATOM) (optimized inference). LumenRL supports both **RL post-training** (GRPO, DAPO, PPO) and **Speculative Decoding Draft Distillation (SDDD)** on AMD GPUs.

## News

- **[2026/05]** LumenRL now supports **Speculative Decoding Draft Distillation (SDDD)** — Eagle3 draft distillation for Kimi K2.5 and Qwen3-8B on MI350 with [Mooncake](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake)/MORI RDMA transfer
- **[2026/04]** LumenRL now supports **fully async training** — inspired by [VERL](https://github.com/verl-project/verl), decouples rollout and training for up to 2.7x throughput improvement
- **[2026/03]** LumenRL now supports **MoE [R3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11370) router alignment** — Rollout Routing Replay for stable MoE RL training
- **[2026/03]** LumenRL now supports the **[FP8-RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18150) quantization stack** — FP8 rollout + training with TIS/MIS importance-sampling correction

## Features

- **AMD-Native**: Built for ROCm with [AITER](https://github.com/ROCm/aiter) kernels (ASM / CK / Triton) and [MORI](https://github.com/ROCm/mori) communication (RDMA + GPU collective ops, MoE expert dispatch)
- **Quantization End-to-End**: Quantized rollout (FP8, MXFP8, MXFP4) and quantized training with importance-sampling rollout correction (TIS/MIS) — up to 44% throughput gain over BF16
- **MoE-Stable RL**: Rollout Routing Replay (R3) aligns train/inference routers to prevent MoE training collapse
- **Speculative Decoding Draft Distillation (SDDD)**: Train Eagle3/DFlash draft models via teacher hidden-state distillation with [Mooncake](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake)/MORI RDMA transfer
- **Flexible Backends**: FSDP2 or Megatron-Core training, ATOM/SGLang/vLLM inference with TP/EP/DP parallelism
